> Math training for my son

This is a math training application I made for my son, to help him learn the
basics of math. In time he found more exciting math training apps elsewhere, so
I'm leaving this here in its unfinished state.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
